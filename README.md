Selenium UI and Rest Assured API testing
UI testing is for adding the first book in the list after searching for string 'qa testing for beginners' in search bar in Amazon.com
Below are some points to keep in mind before running the UI test script
1.Any user who has an Amazon account(with address and credit card setup) can give the credentials in the application.properties file, which will be read and executed in the program. Also,please provide the chrome driver path in this file
2.I have created this test case for adding just one book to the cart as per the requirement. Cart should be empty initially.
3. My assumptions : Selenium UI Test script will choose first available shipping address, Free shipping and First available payment option available

Rest assured testing - I have created methods for Create/Get/Delete services
